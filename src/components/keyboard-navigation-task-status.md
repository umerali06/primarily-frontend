# Keyboard Navigation Implementation - Task Status

## Task Completed: Enhance Item Selection System with Keyboard Navigation

As part of task 4.1 "Enhance item selection system", we have successfully implemented keyboard navigation and shortcuts for the enhanced views in the Primarily-like Items Dashboard.

### Implementation Details

1. Created a utility file `keyboardNavUtils.js` with:

   - Key constants and helper functions
   - View-specific keyboard handlers for list, table, and grid views
   - A custom hook for easy integration

2. Updated the following components to support keyboard navigation:

   - EnhancedListView
   - EnhancedTableView
   - EnhancedItemsGrid
   - VirtualizedEnhancedListView
   - VirtualizedEnhancedTableView

3. Added a KeyboardShortcutsGuide component that:

   - Displays all available keyboard shortcuts
   - Can be opened with the ? key
   - Shows shortcuts organized by category

4. Added global keyboard event listeners in the PrimarilyItemsTabOptimized component

### Features Implemented

1. **Keyboard Navigation**

   - Arrow key navigation in all view modes (grid, list, table)
   - Home/End keys to jump to first/last item
   - Page Up/Down for faster navigation in list and table views
   - Enter key to view item details
   - Delete/Backspace keys to delete selected items

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**

   - Ctrl+A to select all items
   - ? key to open keyboard shortcuts guide
   - Escape key to close modals and panels

3. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Proper ARIA attributes for screen readers
   - Focus management for keyboard navigation
   - Visual indicators for keyboard focus

### Testing

The keyboard navigation has been tested in all view modes (grid, list, table) with both standard and virtualized components. All keyboard shortcuts work as expected.

### Next Steps

- Consider adding more advanced keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Implement customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Add keyboard navigation for filter panels and modals

This implementation completes task 4.1 "Enhance item selection system" by adding keyboard shortcuts for selection and navigation.
