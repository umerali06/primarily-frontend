   - Customizable tooltips with different positions (top, right, bottom, left)
   - Support for different types (info, help, warning)
   - Interactive tooltips that can be hovered or clicked
   - Automatic positioning to stay within viewport

2. **FieldHelp Component**

   - Field-specific help text
   - Example values
   - Validation guidance

3. **ValidationGuidance Component**

   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Rule-based validation with visual indicators
   - Field-specific validation rules

4. **EnhancedFormField Component**

   - Integrated contextual help
   - Validation guidance
   - Accessible form controls
   - Support for different input types

5. **Contextual Help Utilities**
   - Predefined help text for common fields
   - Validation guidance for common fields
   - Example values for common fields

## Key Features

### 1. Tooltips

Tooltips provide contextual information when users hover over or click on elements. They can be positioned in different directions and contain rich content.

**Implementation:**

- Automatic positioning to ensure tooltips stay within the viewport
- Support for HTML content
- Different types (info, help, warning) with appropriate icons
- Interactive tooltips that can be hovered or clicked

### 2. Field-Specific Help

Each form field can have specific help text that explains its purpose and provides guidance on how to fill it out.

**Implementation:**

- Predefined help text for common fields
- Custom help text for specific fields
- Example values to guide users
- Consistent help icon placement

### 3. Validation Guidance

Validation guidance provides real-time feedback on whether the user's input meets the required criteria.

**Implementation:**

- Rule-based validation with visual indicators
- Field-specific validation rules
- Real-time validation feedback
- Clear error messages

### 4. Enhanced Form Fields

Enhanced form fields combine all the contextual help features into a single component that provides a consistent user experience.

**Implementation:**

- Integrated tooltips and help text
- Validation guidance
- Accessible form controls
- Support for different input types

## Usage Examples

### Basic Tooltip

```jsx
<Tooltip content="This is a tooltip">
  <button>Hover me</button>
</Tooltip>
```

### Field Help

```jsx
<FieldHelp fieldName="name" />
```

### Validation Guidance

```jsx
<ValidationGuidance
  fieldName="name"
  value={value}
  validationRules={[
    {
      validate: (value) => value && value.length >= 2,
      message: "Name must be at least 2 characters long",
    },
  ]}
/>
```

### Enhanced Form Field

```jsx
<EnhancedFormField
  label="Name"
  name="name"
  value={value}
  onChange={handleChange}
  validationRules={validationRules.name}
  required
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**

   - Users understand what information is required
   - Users receive immediate feedback on their input
   - Users can access help without leaving the current context

2. **Reduced User Errors**

   - Clear guidance on what is expected
   - Real-time validation prevents submission of invalid data
   - Example values show the expected format

3. **Increased User Confidence**
   - Users understand why information is being requested
   - Users know when they've provided valid information
   - Users can access help when they need it

## Accessibility Considerations

- All tooltips and help text are accessible to screen readers
- Keyboard navigation is supported for all interactive elements
- ARIA attributes are used to provide additional context
- Color is not the only indicator of validation status

## Future Improvements

1. **Contextual Help System**

   - Context-aware help based on user actions
   - Guided tours for new users
   - Progressive disclosure of advanced features

2. **Enhanced Validation**

   - Cross-field validation
   - Asynchronous validation
   - Custom validation rules

3. **User Preferences**
   - Allow users to customize help level
   - Remember user preferences
   - Adapt help based on user expertise
