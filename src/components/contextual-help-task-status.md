# Task Status: Add Contextual Help

## Task Completed: 5.5 Add contextual help

As part of task 5.5 "Add contextual help", we have successfully implemented contextual help features with tooltips, field-specific help, and validation guidance.

### Implementation Details

1. Created a reusable tooltip component (`Tooltip.jsx`) with:

   - Customizable positions (top, right, bottom, left)
   - Different types (info, help, warning)
   - Interactive tooltips
   - Automatic positioning within viewport

2. Created field help components:

   - `FieldHelp.jsx` for field-specific help text
   - `ValidationGuidance.jsx` for validation rules and feedback
   - `FormFieldWithHelp.jsx` for form fields with integrated help
   - `EnhancedFormField.jsx` for advanced form fields with validation

3. Created utility files:

   - `contextualHelpUtils.js` with predefined help text and validation guidance

4. Created demo components:

   - `ContextualHelpDemo.jsx` to showcase basic tooltips and field help
   - `EnhancedFormDemo.jsx` to demonstrate enhanced form fields with validation

5. Created documentation:
   - `CONTEXTUAL_HELP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` with detailed implementation information

### Features Implemented

1. **Tooltips**

   - Customizable tooltips with different positions and types
   - Interactive tooltips that can be hovered or clicked
   - Automatic positioning to stay within viewport

2. **Field-Specific Help**

   - Predefined help text for common fields
   - Example values to guide users
   - Consistent help icon placement

3. **Validation Guidance**

   - Rule-based validation with visual indicators
   - Field-specific validation rules
   - Real-time validation feedback

4. **Enhanced Form Fields**
   - Integrated tooltips and help text
   - Validation guidance
   - Accessible form controls

### Testing

The contextual help features have been tested with various scenarios:

- Different field types (text, number, select, textarea)
- Different validation rules
- Different screen sizes
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility

### Next Steps

- Integrate contextual help into existing forms and components
- Add more field-specific help text and validation rules
- Implement context-aware help based on user actions
- Add guided tours for new users

This implementation completes task 5.5 "Add contextual help" by implementing tooltips for fields, adding help icons with additional information, and creating field-specific validation guidance.
